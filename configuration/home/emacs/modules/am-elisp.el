;;; Commentary:
;; Configuration for Emacs LISP, mostly adding a few hooks here and there and
;; making it so that any files are automatically byte compiled when there exists
;; a previously byte compiled version, and adding a macro expansion library.

;;; Code:
;;; `emacs-lisp':
;; Adds auto compilation for packages and libraries on load and save if there
;; exists a newer version of it, adds `outline-minor-mode' and `reveal-mode' to
;; this mode and allows us to use `C-c e' to expand any code that contains
;; macros.

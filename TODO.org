* TODO Convert to nix-derivation [4/8]
- [ ] Add ~:ensure-system-packages~ to ~emacs.nix~ file to ensure that they are
  always installed together with Emacs.
  - This turned out to be a major pain in the ass with =aspell=, maybe reconsider?
- [X] Fix with-editor crapping out because it cannot find a suitable emacslient
  - Fixed by doing ~nix-env -f emacs.nix --install~ and not just ~nix-build
    emacs.nix~
- [X] Figure out how to always copy Emacs to ~/Applications/~
- [ ] Configure Async again to byte compile stuff asynchronously
- [ ] Stuff Amalthea back into my ~.dotfiles~ repo
- [X] Write documentation for attempting to use this configuration with Nix and
  not Borg
- [ ] Move what packages I can over to Melpa stable instead of unstable
- [X] Fix spellchecker not working properly
  - It is really wonky, had to create my own overlay and shit

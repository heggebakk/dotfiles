* TODO Convert to nix-derivation [5/9]
- [ ] Add ~:ensure-system-packages~ to ~emacs.nix~ file to ensure that they are
  always installed together with Emacs.
  - This turned out to be a major pain in the ass with =aspell=, maybe reconsider?

  - Fixed by doing ~nix-env -f emacs.nix --install~ and not just ~nix-build
    emacs.nix~
- [X] Figure out how to always copy Emacs to ~/Applications/~
- [ ] Configure Async again to byte compile stuff asynchronously

- [X] Write documentation for attempting to use this configuration with Nix and
  not Borg
- [X] Move what packages I can over to Melpa stable instead of unstable
- [X] Fix spellchecker not working properly
  - It is really wonky, had to create my own overlay and shit

  compile I get warnings...

;;; Commentary:

;; Support for the Language Server Protocol and the various associated packages
;; that use/feed it.

;;; Code:

;;; `lsp-mode':
;; The bread and butter for LSP, the only thing we'll configure is disabling
;; Flymake because we're using Flycheck instead.
(use-package lsp-mode
  :commands lsp
  :delight " ‚ìÅ"
  :init (csetq lsp-prefer-flymake nil))

;;; `lsp-ui':
;; Gives us some goodies while browsing the code.
(use-package lsp-ui
  :after lsp-mode
  :commands lsp-ui-mode
  :ghook ('lsp-mode-hook #'lsp-ui-mode))

;;; `company-lsp':
;; Enables auto-completion for languages that use LSP.
(use-package company-lsp
  :after company
  :commands company-lsp
  :init (push 'company-lsp company-backends))

(provide '+lsp)
;;; +lsp.el ends here

;;; Commentary:

;; Syntax and spell checking for both programming and regular languages, using
;; `flyspell' and `flycheck' to configure them. Requirements are that you need
;; to have `hunspell' installed for this to work, though `use-package' will try
;; to install it for you.

;;; Code:

;;; `spelling-hydra':
;; A hydra for quickly moving through your buffer, moving from one error to the
;; other, checking and correcting them as you go. Also enables toggling of
;; either straight up `flyspell' or of it's `prog-mode'.
;;
;; Ever so lightly stolen from rmberYou

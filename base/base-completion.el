;;; Commentary:

;; Provides auto completion powered by `Company', snippet expansions powered by
;; `Yasnippet' and `hippie-expand'.

;; We'll also be replacing the built-in auto-completion framework that comes
;; with Emacs, even `ido' with `Ivy'. I find that the default way that Emacs
;; does completion of filenames and commands is pretty bad, especially compared
;; to what `Counsel' can do. You could also use `Helm', but I like the more
;; minimalist approach that `Ivy' has.

;;; Code:

;;; `Ivy', `Counsel' and `Swiper':

;;; `Ivy':
;; Ivy is the generic auto completion frontend that we'll be using for
;; completion instead of the built-in mechanisms in Emacs.

;;; `Counsel':
;; Counsel is built on top of Ivy and contains a bunch of improved interfaces
;; for mechanisms in Emacs, like finding files or opening recent files etc.

;;; Commentary:

;; The currently unreleased version of Emacs (version 27) introduces yet another
;; init file, this one called `early-init.el', which runs before `package.el'
;; and the interface is initialized. This is useful for optimizing the boot
;; process of Emacs even more.

;; What we do are some fairly well known optimizations, we disable the file name
;; handler as it is called on every `require' and `load', so this will
;; marginally speed up the boot. Then we change the the garbage collectors
;; values so it doesn't start collecting too early. We reset both of these
;; values once Emacs has started. Last, but not least, we tell Emacs not to
;; worry about `package.el'.

;; Finally we disable a few bars that we don't need since we can now do this
;; before they are initialized, saving us a tiny flash of them when we boot up.
